                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>VAULT is a user-friendly banking app that empowers users/students to effectively manage their finances by setting and tracking personalized financial goals, helping users stay on top of their spending and savings.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="problem">
                    <h1>Problem</h1>
                <p>Students often face difficulties in managing their finances due to limited income, fluctuating expenses, and a lack of financial literacy tools designed with their needs in mind. Many existing banking apps are too complex or lack features to address these challenges, leaving students overwhelmed and unprepared.</p>
                </section>
                <h1>My Role</h1>
                    <p> As the UX/UI Designer for this project, I was responsible for research, wireframing, and user experience design. I conducted Competitor analysis, user interviews, created low-fidelity sketches and wireframes, and developed user flows to ensure an intuitive budgeting experience. </p>
                
                <h1>Goal</h1>
                    <p>The goal of this project is to provide financial education for students and facilitate their budgeting. In so doing, students may ease their financial tension and equip themselves with knowledge concerning the management of their finances into future self-empowerment. Additionally, it will remove the muddled nature of finance and thus make it a more convenient subject.</p>

                <h1>Research Methods & Rationale</h1>
                <p> The objective of my research is to gather data to address students’ financial struggles and improve their financial budgeting and literacy. I aim to achieve this through research methods such as competitor analysis, interviews and surveys. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I chose to start with competitor analysis because I can learn from already existing apps this will help identify gaps in already existing ones and figure out what I could do differently in the future.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                   My second step in gathering data were interviews because I can get more in-depth knowledge of the user's pains and needs as well as backstories and specific challenges, which will help me gather their experience when using these apps or going to school. </p>

                        Cons - Limited features, Can’t sync with bank accounts, can’t track financial goals, device specific.

                    <h1>Interviews</h1>
                    <p>I conducted a total of six interviews with students from Humber College to gain insight into their financial challenges and habits.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Their feedback helped shape the project’s direction, ensuring it effectively addresses their needs by making financial management more accessible and stress-free.

                    <h6>Challenges with Budgeting:</h6>
                    <p>
                        Many participants find it hard to keep track of expenses consistently.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                    •	Teija: Only tracks bills occasionally; spends without a concrete plan.
                    <br>

                    •	Arvin: Struggles with surprise costs disrupting plans.
                    <br>

                    •	Siddhi: Finds tracking methods like writing down expenses ineffective for accountability.
                    <br>

                    •	Food was unanimously the hardest expense to control across all participants.
                    <br>

                    •	Teija: Gas expenses.
                    <br>

                    •	Arvin: Spontaneous purchases.
                    <br>

                    •	Siddhi: Accumulated small purchases.
                    <br>

            <section id="sketches">
                <h1>Sketches</h1>
                    <p>After Conducting my research and gaining the feedback from my interviews, this helped me structure the layout and direction for my sketches.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    When making these sketches I made two userflows for users to test.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    User Flow 1: The user has to set up a budget plan.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    User Flow 2: The user has to manually enter a transaction fee to log thier expenses.
                    </p>

                        </div>
            </section>
                <h1>Low Fidelity</h1>
                    <p>After completing my sketches, I moved into the low-fidelity stage, creating wireframes to map out the app’s core functionality and user experience. My goal was to design a simple, intuitive interface that makes financial management accessible for students.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        These low-fidelity wireframes allowed me to test usability, gather feedback, and refine the design before moving into high-fidelity prototyping.
                    </p>
                        <div class="development-uxui fade-in-section">
                            <img src="images/Vault/Vault-lowfidelity.webp" alt="Vault Low Fidelity">
                        </div>
            </section>
              
            
                
                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>I did the user research, low-fidelity prototyping, and testing to create key user flows that would allow easy budgeting and expense tracking and enhance the fun of managing finances with the goal of reducing financial stress and honing budgeting skills for the student population. </p>
                    <h1>Future Steps</h1>
                    <p>Moving Forward, I will conduct usability testings to gain feedback and refine the design even further. Depending on what I learn from this, I will add more user flows and expand app functions to enhance usability and make the experience much better. Since there's always room for improvement, I will iterate upon the design until it is fully usable and truly user-centered.</p>
